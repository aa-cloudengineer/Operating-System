Microsoft created the Windows operating system in the mid-1980s. There have been many different versions of Windows, 
but the most recent ones are Windows 10 (released in 2015), Windows 8 (2012), Windows 7 (2009), and Windows Vista (2007).
Windows comes pre-loaded on most new PCs, which helps to make it the most popular operating system in the world.
